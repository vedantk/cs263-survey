\section{Introduction}

Shape analysis techniques statically determine whether the contents of a
program's memory will preserve a set of structural invariants. The basic
problems in shape analysis are (1) to decompose a program into a set of
locations, (2) to conservatively determine what these locations point to,
and (3) to use this `points-to' information to uncover the shape of
structures in memory. In short, the goal of shape analysis is to answer deep
questions about a program's memory-usage patterns without actually running
it. 

The ability to answer these questions is powerful and broadly applicable. In
the field of compile-time optimization, the task of automatically
transforming a program into parallel fragments requires shape analysis to
flag conflicting memory operations [LH88]. The graph structures used in
several shape analysis methods (e.g [HPR89], [LH88], and [SRW96]) are
amenable to solving this problem, and other related dependency-tracking
problems which arise in optimization. In the field of program verification,
shape analysis can be used to check sophisticated invariants such as
`is-a-list', `is-a-tree', and `is-a-circular-list' [SRW96].

This paper is organized in a top-down fashion. Section 1 characterizes shape
analysis, states the basic problems in the field, and motivates further
study. Section 2 delves into the fundamental approaches to solving shape
analysis problems. Section 3 discusses the achievements of the field and the
state of the art. Section 4 presents the challenges and open problems in the
field. Section 5 suggests directions for future work and concludes.

\section{Achievements and Applications}

See Sagiv/Reps.

Pausing and inspecting a running program would give us the information we
need to solve the shape analysis for a fixed instant in time. 

When a program is actually run, we can think of each of its variables as

At runtime, we can conceptually think of creating a new location for a
program variable each time it is updated. 

\section{Challenges and Open Problems}

Three program properties make totally-precise static shape analysis
infeasible: non-determinism, recursion, and destructive updating.

\section*{Notes}

:: Survey Guidelines

1) Pick an area in which you are interested. Alternatively, pick a paper
   from a recent POPL or PLDI conference. 
2) Read thoroughly 3-6 papers (or a monograph?). Read at least superficially
   3-6 other papers. 
3) Write a report on what you have learned (max 6 pages)
        - What are the basic problems
        - What are the basic approaches to solving them
        - What are the main achievements to date
        - What are open problems
Keep the scope narrow enough so you can say something interesting, and cover
2-3 lectures worth of material.

===========================================================================

Topic: shape analysis.

:: What is the goal of shape analysis?

Shape analyses determine the structure of dynamically-updated storage
statically.

:: Why is this important?

Most immediately, it lets us answer questions about how a program organizes
memory without running it. For example, we may specify a set of invariants
for objects in memory and determine whether or not these invariants are ever
violated (i.e we may model-check data structures). Shape analysis enables
invariants which constrain memory accesses, allowing us to answer relevant
questions about memory sharing and reachability in programs.

Specific applications of shape analysis techniques include detecting null
pointer dereferences, faulty handling of memory deallocation or destruction,
and memory leaks.

:: Is shape analysis a hard problem? Why (what are the 'basic problems')?

Undecidibility, false positives, conservativeness, time bounds (?).

Loss of precision due to abstract interpretation, simplifications which do not
reflect the properties of real-world programs (e.g ignore NULL dereferences,
treat allocations as cons cells).

:: What are the general approaches to performing shape analysis?

- L\&H: Construct an `alias graph' using abstract interpretation over a lattice
  structure, then answer structural queries by traversing the graph.
- M\&S: Construct a `shape graph' via similar means. The meet operation of the
  shape graph lattice differs from that of L\&H, and indeed the structure of the
  shape nodes is also very different. This class of graph is still constructed
  via similar means (i.e abstract interpretation, with a lattice structure to
  merge graphs).

:: What is the current state-of-the-art in shape analysis?

- Candidate: shape graphs of M\&S, see their discussion.
- Candidate: a more recent paper by M\&S which concerns parameterized 3-valued
  logic.

- Mention demand-driven techniques (Atkinson, Griswold, 1998)

:: What unsolved problems remain? How can we make progress in this field?

- Make it faster
    - Select data structures with thought for the underlying architecture
    - Create parallel analyses
- Make it more precise
- Make it more usable: how do we implement practical, fast analyses?
	o Papers often omit how to implement a mechanism for submitting queries
	  to the `shape graph' or equivalent data structure.  
	o Detail on efficient, parallel computation of these structures is also
	  lacking.

      (old intro)
Shape analysis techniques generate a static approximation of the dynamic
structure of program memory. The basic problems in shape analysis are (1) to
decompose a program into a set of locations, (2) to conservatively determine
what these locations point to, and (3) to determine whether the contents of
program memory will preserve an arbitrary set of shape invariants. The goal
of shape analysis is to answer deep questions about a program's memory-usage
patterns without actually running it. The ability to answer these questions
is powerful and broadly applicable.

For example, shape analysis is applied in compile-time optimizations.
Consider the problem of automatically transforming a program into fragments
which run in parallel. Any such compiler transformation must find
statements in the program which contain conflicting memory accesses, and
ensure that these statements are not executed at the same time [LH88]. The
graph structures used in several shape analysis algorithms (e.g [HPR89],
[LH88], and [SRW96]) are amenable to solving this problem, and other related
dependency-tracking problems which arise in optimization.

Shape analysis is also applied to in program verification. In fact, authors
occasionally demonstrate the efficacy of their shape analysis techniques by
verifying semantic properties of code fragments. For example, the method
presented in [SRW96] is used to verify that a list-reversal algorithm
maintains the invariant that a designated list head pointer always points to
a linked list structure. The same paper supports other sophisticated shape
invariants such as `is-a-tree' and `is-a-circular-list'. The ability to
check for and enforce such invariants statically is useful.
